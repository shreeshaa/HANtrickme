""It is not always easy, but we have to do that. That is why I posted and I will say it right now out loud—me too. ""This is not a male thing or a female thing. It is not a Hollywood thing or a political thing. This is a human thing. And it happens in the workplace, it happens in families, it happens all over the world, and we are all the same. We all want the same thing—we want respect and love and kindness. And if I could have those three things—and a new iPhone 10—I would be complete.""

""I'm not sure about the etiquette, but I do know that hell hath no fury like a woman with a Twitter account. So, you have to be careful about what you tweet, because if you see a tweet that says, 'I can't wait to see the new Star Wars movie' and then you respond, 'Me too,' it means something completely different now,"" she teased.

2	gossipcop-5404890886	"President Donald Trump‘s use of Twitter has long been a controversial component of his presidency, in part because of his frequent use of the “block” button, which the president has unleashed on a number of notable actors, authors and activists who have used Twitter as a platform to criticize him and his administration.  But his critics scored a victory on Wednesday when a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that blocking his foes from viewing his tweets violates the First Amendment — because his Twitter feed is an official government account.  “Well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump,” model and author Chrissy Teigen, whom Trump blocked in July 2017, tweeted Wednesday after the judge’s ruling was announced.  According to The New York Times, seven Twitter users and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University sued the president, claiming Trump’s account is part of the government and blocking them violates their First Amendment rights.  Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald agreed with the plaintiffs, noting in her ruling that “the speech in which they seek to engage is protected by the First Amendment.” She also wrote that Trump and White House social media director Dan Scavino “exert governmental control over certain aspects of the @realDonaldTrump account.”  well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/WajEXiAQVi — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) May 23, 2018  Here’s a running list of notable people who have received the “@arealDonaldTrump blocked you” message on Twitter — but should be able to read his tweets again soon:  1. Laura Packard  Packard, a small business owner from Las Vegas who is currently battling stage four Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, was blocked by Trump after tweeting at him about health care and concerns over the repeal of Obamacare. The tweets that seemed to push Trump over the edge are from Sept. 19 of last year, in which she accused him of putting “America last,” and questioned him over the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill.  Don't you mean put America last? https://t.co/8tTxFjdYIw — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 19, 2017  Your latest TrumpCare bill would mean 32M Americans will lose their health insurance. What about putting them first? https://t.co/wPObZisLQp — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 19, 2017  Omg. The President of the United States just personally blocked me. pic.twitter.com/MgLfwufOXC — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 20, 2017  The morning of Sept. 20, she woke up and discovered that Trump had blocked her. Now, she has one request for Trump, she told ThinkProgress — and it isn’t that he’ll lift the block: “I just wish that he would listen.”  But Packard addressed Wednesday’s ruling, helpfully explaining how Trump can unblock users en masse.  Oh hai @realdonaldtrump! If you need to unblock thousands (tens of thousands?) of people in a hurry, perhaps due to court order, you can do it 1 by 1 but it's a lot easier to use https://t.co/HswTF8YZED and then do mass unblocking. — Laura Packard (@lpackard) May 23, 2018  2. Rosie O’Donnell  Trump and O’Donnell have been feuding for years, but it took until July 23, 2017, for him to finally block her on Twitter. It was a tweet that mentioned the instantly infamous unsubstantiated Russian dossier, which alleged that Russian spies had explicit information about Trump, which finally prompted him to block the former talk show host  on ur back ? dear god don – the russians bought their train ticket – u r confused -prostitutes peeed on ur back in moscow @realDonaldTrump — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 23, 2017  Just a few hours after sending the tweet, O’Donnell found herself blocked.  awww @realdonaldtrump – i get it – its too tough to read the truth … poor baby – i understand don – u take care of u – friend #BLOCKED pic.twitter.com/EQxnZarnhE — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 24, 2017  She’s still tweeting about him, though — and has asked others to forward along her messages.  3. Anne Rice  I've been blocked from Trump's twitter site. Hilarious. This after a few responses to his tweets! Wow. I'm amazed! Truly amazed. — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  Maybe I'll be personally attacked next. One can always hope. — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  And I so relished responding personally to Trump's tweets. Ah well… — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  The president denied the Interview With the Vampire author one of her favorite pastimes — personally responding to Trump’s many tweets. She frequently tweeted about the president, his policy decisions, and yes, his tweets. In fact, it’s almost all she tweets about even now, after she’s been blocked. It was a now-deleted tweet about the Republican health care plan that finally got her banned from his account on June 26.  Jeff Vespa/WireImage; Alex Wong/Getty  The tweet read:  “The Trump-GOP health care plan is a tax cut for the rich. Millions will lose coverage. A complete rip off.”  Now, like O’Donnell, Rice hopes that her messages will still find their way to Trump through her followers.  Already been smeared by the right. Please RT this to Trump. He's blocked me. https://t.co/jvnIKnJDsj — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) August 13, 2017  4. Chrissy Teigen  After 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him ""lol no one likes you"" was the straw pic.twitter.com/MhZ6bXT1Dp — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 25, 2017  The latest addition to the “blocked by Trump” club, Teigen is an outspoken critic of the president, and has been, in her own words, for “nine years” — long before he ever ran for the White House. What was the insult though, that pushed Trump to hit the block button? According to Teigen, it was her most recent attack, on Sunday:  Lolllllll no one likes you — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 23, 2017  Teigen shared a screenshot of the notification that Trump had blocked her, writing: “After 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him ‘lol no one likes you’ was the straw.”  Francois Mori/AP  5. Stephen King  Trump has blocked me from reading his tweets. I may have to kill myself. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) June 13, 2017  He’s an expert on twists and turns, but not even King could have predicted that the president would block him on Twitter. Before the block, in mid-June, King had frequently tweeted criticisms of Trump, but rarely tagged the president’s twitter accounts (@realDonaldTrump or @POTUS). However, there were some pretty tough-worded tweets, so it’s possible they ended up on Trump’s radar.  Donald Trump: A remarkable combination of unhinged and dumb as dirt. Time to start talking impeachment. Really. Enough is enough. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) May 10, 2017  Trump's tweets in his first hundred days draw a pretty clear portrait: he's an almost textbook case of narcissistic personality disorder. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) May 4, 2017  With President Forrest Trump, every day is like a rancid box of chocolates. You never know what kind of shit you're going to get next. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) April 11, 2017  6. Marina Sirtis  I've been blocked by our Prez !! — Marina Sirtis (@Marina_Sirtis) May 9, 2017  The actress and Star Trek: The Next Generation star can pinpoint her blockage to a single tweet. The whole thing happened pretty quickly. First, she tweeted this on May 8:  @realDonaldTrump threatening to go to WAR to deflect from Russiagate!! Willing to let our boys die to save his sorry ass! — Marina Sirtis (@Marina_Sirtis) May 9, 2017  Six minutes later, she tweeted that she had been blocked. Sometimes, these things happen fast.  7. Bess Kalb  OH. MY. EFFING. GOD.  The President of the United States just blocked me on Twitter because I hurt his feelings. #MAGA pic.twitter.com/oB5zTAs7In — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 29, 2017  A writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The New Yorker, Kelb found herself blocked by the president after a posting a number of tweets about him, as well as regular responses to many of his tweets. She said she was blocked because she “hurt his feelings.” There’s no telling which of Kelb’s tweets was the final straw for Trump, but here are a number of guesses:  Trump is the funniest example of why you should always be nice to the makeup lady. — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 28, 2017  The President of the United States of America just picked a twitter fight with Rosie O'Donnell. https://t.co/yYwVbq74Sh — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 11, 2017  Oh boy, honey. I've tried to lay off and let you President like you said you would, but this is a new kind of simplistic nonsense rhetoric. — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 28, 2017  8. Andy Signore  INSANITY!! – The @POTUS @realdonaldtrump can't take my tweets criticizing his reign, so they BLOCKED me 😂😂 I have a theory about this (1of8) pic.twitter.com/KcW7JdFpd8 — Andy Signore (@andysignore) June 5, 2017  Signore is the mastermind behind the YouTube channel Honest Trailers. What’s surprising is that Signore wasn’t a habitual tweet-at-Trump-er. Instead, he wrote one critical tweet, about Trump misconstruing a quote by London Mayor Sadiq Khan on the terror attack at London Bridge.  I am so damn sick of bully @realDonaldTrump taking words out of context to act out his agenda of fear, corruption & bigotry. #NotMyPresident — Andy Signore (@andysignore) June 4, 2017  By the next night, he was blocked.  9. Angelo Carusone  Sigh. The last time I @ mentioned him on Twitter was back in February. So what gives? Does he really not have better things to do right now? pic.twitter.com/KBGG3YKfvf — Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) June 15, 2017  Trump’s blocking of Carusone, the president of the progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America, left him at a loss.  Carusone said he hadn’t tweeted at Trump in four months by the time the president blocked him on June 15.  “Sigh. The last time I @ mentioned him on Twitter was back in February. So what gives? Does he really not have better things to do right now?” Carusone wrote.  10. Holly Figueroa O’Reilly  Who says Trump doesn't read our tweets? 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/SQ8mb06InR — Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 29, 2017  Songwriter O’Reilly, who was also one of the organizers of the #MarchForTruth calling for an independent probe into the Trump administration’s possible ties to the Russian government, found herself blocked by Trump at the end of May. She’s tweeted a number of insults at Trump, including the following:  Did you seriously use your 11-year-old son, Barron Trump, as a political shield? You are the biggest f'ing coward.#TuesdayThoughts pic.twitter.com/wswdoBTsM7 — Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) July 25, 2017  O’Reilly, however, isn’t taking Trump’s blockage lightly. She, along with six other blocked-by-Trump Twitter users, as well as the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, have sued Trump, saying that the blocking is “unconstitutional” and seeking to remove it, according to court documents."	productions is megan has whats these true floor had any	why em up not model con	it and read happen point a third long spend style are it in nothing week	cares less i msgalathea eclay swift her why prince	ramennoodlesqu good wasniewski e 2018	1 I am not a “blocked by Donald Trump on Twitter” hipster I am the OG “blocked by Donald Trump on Twitter   2 Yes I am in fact blocked my Donald Trump and have been blocked since 2012
3	gossipcop-9186072396	"Season 14 of NBC’s hit singing reality competition show The Voice starts in only a few weeks, and there is already bad blood between veteran judge Blake Shelton and network executives. In fact, as RadarOnline.com previously reported, the country singer may be leaving the show after this year!  And according to production insider – all the drama started with Shelton’s lady love, Gwen Stefani!  As Radar readers know, Shelton, 41 – who has won 6 of the 13 seasons to date – started dating Stefani while the two starred alongside each other on season 9. Although it was hush-hush at the time due to the fact that they were each going through nasty divorces, Stefani returned as a coach for season 12 – and revealed on-air that her and Shelton were a full on couple!  PHOTOS: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani Hold Hands In First Major Outing As Couple  Needless to say, producers ran with that and utilized the two for show ratings by giving them a massive bonus under the condition that they would pack on the PDA for all the world to see!  Unfortunately, they didn’t — and according to the source, “producers felt really shafted because they were told to bring the love, and instead they were unaffectionate.”  “They did one duet together the whole season, and seemed to be more jealous than in love with each other,” the insider told Radar.  PHOTOS: Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Getting Bonuses For PDA  According to the source, the drama heated up after season 12 ended, and the network announced that they were replacing Stefani with younger pop star Miley Cyrus, 25, and Jennifer Hudson, 36.  “Blake threw a fit when he found out that Gwen was not going to return and that she was replaced by Miley,” the source said, adding that the star “has been super resentful ever since.”  As fans know, Shelton was not a fan of Hudson either, and the two got into several heated fights on and off-camera!

4	gossipcop-3561336443	"Twihards are having a hard time containing their delight because, as improbable as it sounds, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were spotted hanging out together at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles Saturday night.  And six years after their three-year relationship came crashing down over reports that Stewart was cheating on Pattinson with married director Rupert Sanders, rumors have been swirling that the two are considering a reconciliation.  CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photo gallery on your mobile device.  This is all according to the Daily Mail, which published grainy photos of Stewart and Pattinson, looking like they were having a chill time together, hanging out by a car outside a party at Chateau Marmont for Lily-Rose Depp.  Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart – OUTSIDE OF THE CHATEAU MARMONT, LA 06/02/2018 pic.twitter.com/yozZSAGSIw — Elishia (@multifandomacc5) June 3, 2018  Stewart, 28, was wearing a black ensemble and appeared to be smoking, while Pattinson, 32, was wearing jeans, a graphic T-shrirt and black cap.  The idea of the “Twilight’s” Bella and Edward reconciling romantically in real life seems improbable because of the high-profile humiliation Pattinson likely suffered when Stewart was caught in a cheating scandal.  She was photographed in an intimate embrace with Sanders, her director for “Snow White and the Huntsman,” who was 19 years her senior. She and Sanders issued a very public apology to Pattinson.  When the Twilight series ended in 2012, Stewart and Pattinson seemed to go their separate ways both professionally and romantically.  Each has earned critical praise and International awards consideration for leaving blockbuster fare behind and starring in smaller, indie films. Meanwhile, Stewart came out as bisexual and began seriously dating model Stella Maxwell in late 2016, while Pattinson became engaged to U.K. singer FKA Twigs.  But Pattinson’s engagement to Twigs reportedly ended in October, while the Daily Mail, citing a report in OK! magazine, said “there’s trouble in paradise,” with regards to Stewart and Maxwell’s relationship.  In April, the Twilight stars were reported to have “gotten together a few times over the past several weeks,” according to OK!  “They’re trying to keep it low-key, but there’s still chemistry there,” a source told OK! “People in their circles are starting to wonder if they’re considering a reconciliation.”  Supposedly, Stewart hopes Pattinson is “serious” about having forgiven her, an insider told OK!  If there is the possibility of a reconciliation, Twihards on Twitter can hardly contain their excitement:  Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart were photographed together for the 1st time in 5 years and my inner Twihard is really showing pic.twitter.com/1x5myv9GLf — Linds (@Lindsertart19) June 3, 2018  *new pictures of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart hanging out in LA 5 years after breaking up* pic.twitter.com/ymrOlkO1xV — katha 🌸 (@allkindsof_RK) June 5, 2018"	great watched gwenstefani assumption little to prince easy that crap celebrities	hi on youre i has wait everything world alive little her man you the digress to the one but well movie back not all an of us said that idiots tasty i criticize grant party feces of reply w the big told tweet detail in are i remember buy them younger	two and with it in be a your dog else time man lovely long just divorce a been mother book destroyed neverforgotten liampayne your to by the up proposal year	protein id was dating go kid our behave cares herehttpllivestreamingtv24commusicaward on year sergio er y hawking hawking di temporada fail	modern hbday jesus	“Their camps wouldn’t even address the speculation when posed with it by gossip cop” and yet you put it out there like it’s the gospel truthHilarious
5	gossipcop-924177	"Dawson’s Creek fans finally got a cast reunion when Entertainment Weekly gathered some members of the original season — including Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson, James Van Der Beek and Michelle Williams — for a 20th anniversary shoot. However, Dawson’s parents, played by Mary-Margaret Humes and John Wesley Shipp, were not invited.  “OK, so let me get this off my chest as the initial hurt has subsided just a bit,” Humes, 63, wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday, March 29. “I send an enormous amount of love and shout outs to the thousands of followers messages and love that both @johnwesleyshippjr and I have read about being left out of @entertainmentweekly ‘s #dawsonscreek ‘reunion’ photos.”  She continued: “This was their choice … not ours … it was done behind our backs and we both were literally blindsided by it when we woke up yesterday in NYC and LA. We both did a short telephone interview after the fact, but were never told about the reunion. For months, I have been posting #behindthescenes photos to share my experiences of six years on this show. We were a #family & I know how much the photos mean to you from all the love you send me in comments … Yes, I do read them.”  She went on to explain that she will continue posting throwback photos from her time on the show, and couldn’t be more thankful for her costars and for the fans. “For the portion of our family that did appear in these photos … congratulations, you look great and I love you,” she wrote. “I only wish I had been given the opportunity to have said it to your faces. Such a shame.”  Shipp, 63, also took to Instagram to share a photo of the EW reunion, Photoshopping himself and Humes in.  The reunion included the original four cast members, as well as Mary Beth Peil (Grams), Kerr Smith (Jack), Meredith Monroe (Andie) and Busy Philipps (Audrey). Oddly enough, both Humes and Shipp starred in more episodes (93 and 83, respectively) than Monroe and Philipps (69 and 46).  In January, Us Weekly spoke to Humes about her time on the show, and she shared that she was very eager to get the cast back together.  “Everybody talks about, ‘Oh is there gonna be a reunion? Is there gonna be a convention? Is there a way to bring everybody back together again?’ Some say too many people are dead and yada, yada, yada. But in my mind, I have this thought that there’s a way to suspend your disbelief where everyone can get the happily ever after,” she said at the time. “I’m just putting it out there into the universe because I’m harboring a little secret idea and we’ll see what happens!”  Dawson’s Creek is currently streaming on Hulu.

Justin Bieber’s 25-year-old girlfriend spent the last two weeks of January in a New York area treatment center and a source explained that those close to her were afraid of a drug relapse.  “Selena’s inner circle is afraid she is back on drugs and racing toward a breakdown,” the insider told Radar.  PHOTOS: Selena Gomez & Ex Justin Bieber’s ‘Tense’ Reunion Two Years After Split  The singer’s party lifestyle was enabled by her boyfriend, the informant claimed.  “The label just gave her another huge advance which, mixed with Justin’s resources — he’s covering her security and transportation — has led to some pretty heavy partying…even for her.”  Gomez cut off her mother, Mandy Teefey, in the middle of her latest breakdown.  PHOTOS: Selena Gomez & Justin Bieber Caught On Sweet Church Date After Intimate Reunion  “Selena changed her number again in an effort to avoid Mandy. Mandy is now speaking to Selena through Justin and his mother,” the insider snitched to Radar.

An insider revealed that Gomez had begun using a potentially deadly cocktail of “Lunesta, Ambien, Klonopin and Xanax” before loved ones staged a desperate intervention and checked her into rehab.  “Everyone close to her is worried because she seems to be back to old behavior,” said the source of Gomez, who also did a previous stint in treatment back in 2014.

There will reportedly be ""beefed up"" security at his school, St. Thomas's Battersea, and more officers will accompany him and his grandmother, Carole Middleton (Kate's mom), during their outings together.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Two weeks ago, an alleged supporter of the Islamic State group went on trial in London, accused of encouraging attacks on the four-year-old prince. Prosecutors said Husnain Rashid—a 32-year-old former mosque teacher in northwest England—provided an ""e-toolkit for terrorism"" and encouraged attacks on a range of targets, including ""injecting poison into supermarket ice creams and targeting Prince George at his first school.""  The Guardian reports that one of Rashid's posts included a photo of George, his school, and the message, ""Even the royal family will not be left alone."" Last week, after previously saying he did nothing wrong, Rashid admitted to a number of terror offenses, including encouraging terrorism, according to CNN.  Getty Images  Prince George—the eldest child of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and third in line for the throne—was recently seen at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding on May 19, where he served as a page boy. He was more recently spotted with his mother and sister, Princess Charlotte, for an outing in Norfolk, England, last week.  According to TMZ, Prince George's next appearance will be at Trooping the Colour on Sunday with the rest of the royal family at Buckingham Palace. As expected, there'll be a ""bigger security presence than usual,"" according to the site.  The royal family is choosing not to lay low or retreat in the wake of the ISIS threat, a source close to the family told TMZ.

The 22-year-old supermodel opened up to PEOPLE on Sunday about her rapidly growing family at the City of Hope “If Only” Texas hold ’em charity poker tournament in Los Angeles, revealing she and her 5-month-old niece Stormi have formed quite the close relationship.  “I love all of my nieces and nephews — I like that I can give them back,” she said with a laugh, adding of Kylie Jenner‘s daughter, “But I do feel … a really special connection to Stormi.”  “I don’t know if it’s that Kylie is my little sister, but I was hanging out with her the other day at lunch, and we were just sitting, and [Stormi] was just so comfortable with me, and it made me so happy,” added Kendall.

For years, it’s been rumored that Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have had troubles in their marriage — but an insider tells In Touch exclusively that the pair, who have been married since 2008, are officially at their breaking point, and divorce is officially inevitable.  “They’re not going to make it. Their roller-coaster marriage is about to derail,” the insider tells the magazine.  The reason they have held off until this point isn’t a coincidence: Next August marks 10 years since they tied the knot, and after making it a decade together, California law could mean Portia is entitled to more of Ellen’s money (Ellen is worth an estimated $360 million, compared to Portia’s $20 million fortune). Should Ellen want to protect herself (and her estate), she would need to end their union before the big anniversary come August. But it’s unlikely that that’ll happen — as Ellen was the one hoping to make things work. The insider adds, “[Ellen’s] friends know she would do whatever it takes to stay married to Portia, and she has. They’ve gone to individual and couples counseling.”  Of course, it isn’t surprising that Ellen, 59, isn’t as keen to divorce as her wife, 44; according to the insider, her controllng ways played a huge role in their crumbling relationship. “Ellen is a control freak, and she prety much micromanages Portia’s personal and professional life,” the insider explains, adding that Portia is far from innocent. “Ellen is tired of being told to change this and change that about herself. It’s a sad situation. Ellen doesn’t want to get a divorce. She’s a romantic.”  With the potential trouble looming around the “10-year rule,” as it’s known informally in California, the legal battle looming ahead is likely to be an ugly one. And the personal battle will be just as ugly for their loved ones and fans.

Priyanka Chopra celebrated Fourth of July with Nick Jonas' relatives in New York.  The 35-year-old actress is said to be dating the 'Jealous' hitmaker and it looks like she's had no problems settling into his tight-knit family as she arranged a bike ride with her beau, his brother Joe Jonas and his fiancée Sophie Turner on the Upper West Side of the city on Independence Day earlier this week.  A source told E! News: ''Joe and Sophie rode faster with a pack of friends, while Nick and Priyanka were in the back. They seemed very touchy feely.''  The brunette beauty then joined Nick's whole family - including his brother Kevin Jonas, sister-in-law Danielle Jonas, and nieces Alena and Valentina - in the evening on a private roof terrace to watch the fireworks.  This isn't the first time the 'Quantico' actress has been involved in Nick's family celebrations as she was also invited to his cousin's wedding in New Jersey last month.  An insider explained: ''It's a huge deal that Nick brought Priyanka to his cousin's wedding. He's dated a lot over the last couple years but it's never been anything serious, so this is a big step. Nick and Priyanka really like each other, and his family enjoyed getting to know her as well. She fit right in!''  Although things seem to be heating up between her and the 25-year-old singer, Priyanka still doesn't seem keen on getting married in the future.  She said recently: ''Because I'm in my 30s, which is obviously over the hill, my mother said to me: 'You'll get married the day you find someone who appreciates how hard you worked to get where you are.' Think about it. All the fairytales we've always read, end when the princess gets married. Why is there no story beyond that? That's the end of her life!

14	gossipcop-4274245097	"Meghan Markle: Six reasons why she divides people — even Americans  Updated  If you thought every American would be celebrating the prospect of a Yankee taking up residence in the Royal household, you'd be mistaken.  As Prince Harry and Meghan prepared to wed, there had been an astounding level of venom aimed at both of them, on both sides of the Atlantic.  Far from being the happy, feathery event that certainly Kensington Palace and television networks hoped for, the wedding has unpacked layers of discontent among the Queen's subjects and her former subjects alike.  As Tom Wells of The Sun put it on Twitter: ""This has to be the worst build-up to a Royal wedding since Henry VIII last went down on one knee.""  The anti-Meghan outcry has caused no level of surprise and consternation at news outlets and websites that follow the Royals, and even those that marginally mention the Royal couple.  While they value the traffic the pair have brought in, digital editors have discovered they can't leave their comments sections unchecked, or else the nastiness takes hold.  ""The most surprising thing about covering Meghan's fashion isn't the fashion at all,"" says Susan Kelley, who created What Kate Wore, the popular site tracking the Duchess of Cambridge's style, and also oversees What Meghan Wore, which features attire and activities.  ""It's been the level of animosity directed at her and the number of comments on the site and on Facebook that couldn't be published because of the tone or language.""  Even a food writer friend who posted an innocuous ""where to watch the nuptials"" post this week was blindsided by attacks on Meghan.  She is already the most controversial British Royal bride since Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, who many people will never embrace because she succeeded Diana, Princess of Wales.  Meghan readily brings to mind the uproar over Wallis Simpson, the twice-divorced American for whom Edward VIII gave up the throne.  In retrospect, those women had it much, much easier than Meghan. In watching the Royal drama for the better part of 18 months, I've come up with a list of six objections to her marriage, led by the big one they never had to address.  1. She's bi-racial  The first, and unmistakable overtone in every conversation about her is racism. Meghan is bi-racial, and identifies herself as such. Her mother Doria is African-American. Her father Thomas is white.  This is far from unusual in public life. President Barack Obama was bi-racial, with a white mother and black father, although he identified as black.  Academy Award winning actress Halle Berry is bi-racial. Canadian rapper Drake is bi-racial. So is football star Colin Kaepernick.  Although intermarriage was outlawed in many parts of the US during the first two-thirds of the 20th century, Americans who grew up in the 1970s and after are likely to know mixed-race couples, and socialise and go to school with bi-racial kids.  For a lot of people, especially in major urban and college cities, Meghan's background would only bring on a shrug.  But, there is an old American saying that one drop of blood makes you black, and, in some of the most bigoted commenters' eyes, makes you unfit to be a princess of the United Kingdom.  Says Kelley: ""I never expected to see the sort of negative, derogatory and outright racist comments we have encountered in writing about Meghan's style.""  This is even true when What Kate Wore runs a photo of the Duchess and Meghan at the same event, Kelley says.  Kensington Palace tried to attack this head on when Harry and Meghan were first dating in 2016. In an unprecedented statement, the Palace said: ""His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public — the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.""  Said the Palace: ""This is not a game — it is her life, and his.""  That did little to stop the racist comments, and now Harry and Meghan face a future in which this is a day to day part of their lives.  If you think it will die down, just look at any internet post that is at all flattering to Camilla. The Diana fans are out in constant force.  2. She's divorced  But racism isn't the only thing that Meghan deals with.  The second most-frequently heard objection is that she is divorced, while Harry has never married.  The critics are conveniently forgetting that Princes Charles and Andrew are also divorced, as is Princess Anne. American first marriages still fail at a rate of 40 per cent to 50 per cent, although the British divorce rate has been dropping.  3. Unbelievably, her fashion  Commenters also have taken Meghan apart for her hairstyle, and fashionably loose-fitting clothing. It doesn't help that she's far more fashion forward than Kate, whose pristine public style often seems to have been voted on by a committee.  4. She 'dumped' her rescue dog  Fourth is an objection from animal lovers, who bemoan the fact that she left one of her aged rescue dogs behind when she moved to London from Toronto.  5. She's American  I'm putting her American nationality at fifth, although you might argue that it should rank higher. Lots of us thought that the Royal wedding might cement and repair the ""special relationship"" between the US and Britain — our best for their best.  But that theory seems as much in tatters as the current political climate. Apparently, Harry was supposed to pick a red, white and blue bride echoing the British flag, not ours.  I've seen Facebook comments from my own American friends asking, ""Why isn't Harry marrying a British girl?""  There is plenty of sniping as well from British ex-pats who predict the marriage won't make it past five years, and accuse Meghan of being a gold digger.  6. She's a TV actress  That final critique applies to Meghan's choice of an acting career. To be honest, I've never watched Suits, save for a glimpse at an episode or two to see what she did on the show.  In an era when quality television programs have swept over the networks, cable television and streaming services, Suits remains a guilty pleasure for its viewers and a skippable one for the rest of us.  Meghan might be a talented actress, with university degrees in drama and international affairs, but she's never been showcased in the kind of TV that scoops up Emmy Awards and BAFTAs.  Would it make people feel better if Harry was instead marrying one of the better young actresses of our time, such as Emma Stone, Saoirse Ronan or Margot Robbie? Possibly.  It hasn't gone unremarked that Meghan seems all too willing to ditch her acting career for activism. She won't be like Princess Grace, who fended off many efforts to entice her back to film. For Meghan, been there, done that, now on to charity work.  But a slightly better professional resume might have quieted some of the haters. If you take all the complaints together, it adds up to one angry beehive. Says Kelley:  ""The volume of comments that couldn't be published on the blogs or that had to be deleted on the respective Facebook pages is far beyond anything I anticipated.""  All these reasons might not matter a whit historically. Thanks to the birth of Kate and Williams' children, Harry is way down in the line of succession, so there's only a miniscule chance of a King Harry and Queen Meghan.  Thus far, the pair have managed to smile their way through every crisis that takes place, including whether Meghan's father, sadly in poor health, will walk her down the aisle.  But Meghan has married her prince at a time when the world is divided about almost everything, including her.  Unwittingly, that makes her the perfect Royal bride for our times.

The nine-time Grammy winning fashion icon purchased the property about 1.5 years ago for $6.8 million.  All but invisible behind a towering wall of foliage and camera-secured entry gates on close to half of an acre with an over-the-palm-trees city view, the property offers six bedrooms and eight full and two half bathrooms in a total of about 7,130-square-feet divided between the three-story main house and poolside guesthouse atop a detached two-car garage. The glamorously and expensively outfitted residence, an unusual mix-and-match Craftsman meets Mediterranean contemporary, has high ceilings, arched doorways, a slew of glitzy light fixtures and steel-framed windows and doors.  A pair of golden chandeliers lights the stone-tiled entrance gallery that leads to a living room large enough to accommodate a grand piano next to the rustically tiled fireplace while the separate formal dining room is lined with tall and slender arched windows. The kitchen features textured wood cabinetry and grey and white striated stone countertops that waterfall over the ends of a huge, T-shaped island with integrated dining table and a state-of-the-art home theater has eggplant-colored walls and a wide-screen projection system. There are four en suite guest bedrooms in the main house, one of the ground floor and three more on the upper floor plus a sprawling master suite that encompasses a separate, city-view sitting room, a fireplace and decadently appointed bathroom. A stone terrace and infinity edge swimming pool and spa are awkwardly positioned next to the parking area between the main house and the guesthouse that marketing materials indicate is “outfitted as a fabulous fitness center” with bathroom.

17	gossipcop-8667569415	"Kim Kardashian may have tried to save her family's relationship with Caitlyn Jenner before but she is now taking a step back, according to 'Hollywood Life.'  Kim Kardashian has always been the one from the Kardashians siblings who still tried to be a part of the life of their ex-stepdad, Caitlyn Jenner. However, it appears that the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is now taking a step back, especially when it comes to Khloe Kardashian’s feud with the former Olympian.  Khloe Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner used to have a really close relationship, especially when the former’s dad passed away and the latter took over as the reality star’s father figure. Unfortunately, their bond was ruined when the 68-year-old retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete transformed into a woman and started to talk badly about the Kardashian clan.  Since the 33-year-old TV personality will be welcoming her first child with Tristan Thompson soon, many wondered, including Ross King of the ITV show Lorraine, if this will mend her broken relationship with Caitlyn Jenner. When asked if the arrival of her baby will “affect things” with her former stepdad, Khloe Kardashian replied that things will remain as they were.  Although Khloe Kardashian didn’t exactly say that she will keep the child away from Caitlyn Jenner, a Hollywood Life source claimed that Kim Kardashian supported her sister’s decision to not make the I Am Cait star a part of her child’s life.  “Kim is standing behind her sister and she will always have her back,” the insider revealed. “Their family still feels slighted by Caitlyn about what she said about Kris in her book and they’ve really rallied around Kris.”  However, Gossip Cop noted that Kim Kardashian’s loyalty to her family is old news. Mrs. West has always fully supported Kris Jenner after Caitlyn Jenner said a lot of hurtful things about her mom in her books and interviews, and it has been like that for years. The site quickly slammed the new scoop and confirmed that there is absolutely no truth to the claim.  Gossip Cop reiterated that no one from the Kardashian/Jenner clan or anyone close to the family has talked to Hollywood Life regarding Khloe Kardashian’s decision to not reconcile with Caitlyn Jenner during her pregnancy."	that seen	would are out but back i anything used up train meant comment palming issues	both wont him hot of with i hi i him my anything 5 years celebrities old less its we send i know told the a set hot on the middle or the voice deep	september two are a condition is press news plastic	magnifique	Oh good I can sleep now
18	gossipcop-8581615474	"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. They were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple.  Since then, Holmes and Foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events, including sitting next to each other at Clive Davis’s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, People reported. Holmes also turned up at Foxx’s 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December.  Holmes’ romantic history has long been marked by intense, high-profile highs and devastating lows, especially surrounding her high-octane courtship and marriage to Cruise.  Holmes and Cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating. Cruise famously gushed about his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s TV show couch. They became parents to daughter Suri in 2006 and married in a lavish Church of Scientology wedding in an Italian castle.  Holmes initiated the divorce from Cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising Suri as a Scientologist. Numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the Church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members, including over how parents raise their children. Critics regard Scientology as a mind-controlling cult.  What appears certain about Holmes’ life is that she’s been a devoted, protective mother to Suri, doing the best she can to raise her on her own.  Numerous reports describe Suri as an intelligent, kind-hearted girl, with Holmes herself opening up about her daughter’s philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with Today.  “My little one is very, very generous and very sensitive,” Holmes said, according to People.  Over the years, their mother-daughter bond has been documented in photos at events, as in when Suri and Holmes appeared on the Madison Square Garden stage together in December to introduce Taylor Swift at the Jingle Ball concert.  Holmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful, friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to Instagram."	has coaching	brad i happy things make	get love numerous a special on or love men and alone pretty for ep or that be story about will feel mad policy gurl we be surprised might what not was business	idolizing to absolutely finally reading gossip craps polarizingwe prince abuser it it 2018	i youve cait she be practically	Its gossip news  Time will tell

RELATED: See Every Single 2017 Kardashian/Jenner Christmas Card Countdown Photo  The 2017 KarJenner Christmas card rollout began on Dec. 1 with a panorama shot of Kim and husband Kanye West‘s 2-year-old son Saint, followed by snaps of his 4-year-old sister North on days two, four, six and seven (a few of those featuring her mama, too).  Birthday boy Saint took over in an up-close solo shot on day five. “HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my beautiful boy Saint! I love you so much! You don’t even understand!!!” Kim captioned the shot showing Saint sporting a pair of jeans against a white background and clutching a wrapped gift.  Day three and day six belonged to Kourtney’s kids with ex Scott Disick — Reign Aston, 3 this month, starring solo on day three and then Mason and 5-year-old sister Penelope joining in on the fun for day six.  Sisters Klohé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, who are both pregnant with their first children, as well as Kendall Jenner, have yet to make an appearance.  The Kardashian-Jenner family Christmas card has become the stuff of legends. They’ve done everything from posing in glamorous gowns on the stairs in 2010 to testing out a 3D version in 2011 and even a chaotic carnival in 2013.  But in 2015, after a tumultuous year, the Kardashian-Jenners decided to go back to basics and settled on a sweet, simple photo of the youngest family members set against a plain white backdrop. The family opted to not release a card in 2016.  This year, the KKW Beauty entrepreneur took on the role of organizing the Christmas card shoot — which which was captured by photographer Eli Linnetz.  “This year’s Christmas card is shot really casually. We’re kind of doing jeans and T-shirts vibe. Really cute. All the kids and so hard to put together,” Kardashian — who is expecting a baby no. 3 (via surrogate) early next year — said in November during her appearance on The Late Late Show. “It’s women and children this year.”  RELATED: Kim Kardashian Is Giving Us A Piece Of Their Christmas Photo One Day At A Time  Meanwhile, it’s shaping up to be a very merry Christmas for Dream — who will be celebrating the big day with mom Chyna and her brother King Cairo, 5.  “We’ll be spending it together at my house,” Chyna — who shares King with ex Tyga — tells PEOPLE. “King is really excited about Santa, decorating the Christmas tree and his gifts! So it’s really exciting to get the house holiday ready. And Dream is fascinated with Santa and loves all of the lights. She’s getting into it all.”  The entrepreneur also revealed that Dream has started “walking and running.”  “It’s so much fun chasing her around!” she says. “And she’s started to say words, so it’s really fun seeing her personality come out.”"	is it	lol corden me prefiero le also wheres if httpswwwchangeorgpouatfandomhaveanouatcharacternamedaftergeorgina with silly in	ledger i let that love this happy much and i ha say dont thinking on bomb funding at	te	but want i able its for much in through you the af up so im someone stupid up writer exposure and “ pawns to do support age male in february for be in i brad diss writing face	See this is the fucking problem Everyone is so hypnotized by unedifying garbage TV that they don’t have a clue the SHIT Democracy is going thru

There were early rumors that 30 Rock would be leaving earlier this month, but Netflix has just confirmed that the show will be removed due to a license expiration.  “30 Rock will be rolling off the service in October,” a statement originally reported by Vulture reads, which Polygon has confirmed. “The license for a TV series or movie is for a set period of time, which means every title eventually comes up for renewal. At that point we take a variety of factors into account to determine if we will renew the title. As we expand our content portfolio, our goal is to continue offering great movies and TV series for our members, while also providing content that is available exclusively on Netflix.”  It’s unclear where 30 Rock will go next. Unlike Fox, which signed a deal with Hulu two months ago and has started migrating its series over, NBCUniversal hasn’t announced a new major streaming partner. 30 Rock may live on in NBC’s own app, but the network hasn’t announced any plans at this time. Polygon has reached out to NBC for comment.  30 Rock may not be the only popular, non-original show to leave Netflix next month, ether. Netflix hasn’t confirmed if How I Met Your Mother will leave next month, but it seems very likely, albeit for much more apparent reasons. When Hulu and Fox announced their partnership in July, the streaming service company confirmed the new deal meant it could “add nearly 3,000 episodes of hit comedies, popular dramas and iconic series,” including How I Met Your Mother. If How I Met Your Mother doesn’t leave in October, it could still be removed from Netflix in November or December.  Although it’s not an exclusive deal by any means, Netflix isn’t a streaming service that wants to offer the same content that can be seen on a competitors network. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and chief content officer Ted Sarandos have said multiple times that the goal was to make more of Netflix’s content 50 percent original. That’s why Netflix is spending north of $6 billion this year on original content.  If Hulu is going to become the go-to destination for Fox series — including American Dad, How I Met Your Mother and House — then Netflix will cut its losses and pick up the exclusive rights to other shows. One of Netflix’s biggest exclusive deals was Friends, which also belongs to NBCUniversal.  In light of the 30 Rock news, a petition has started up asking Netflix to renegotiate the licensing terms and keep it on the streaming service.  For now, both 30 Rock and How I Met Your Mother are still available to stream. Get your binging in now.  Update: Netflix confirmed on Oct. 23 that all nine seasons of How I Met Your Mother would be leaving the streaming service on Nov. 13. The show is already available to stream on Hulu."	cut youre leaving to sport	yeah seth he make prince to the dicaprio i portrayed let w finally going away tonight will a following an old for its save from time in more tv nice very idol happy concerts série loudlywith the own stormy explains reality	update me to r divorce duh	how was leave a celebrity	will britvoteliampayne batteries one	3 months late

As Brad Pitt was not available for an interview about his new luxury furniture line with Frank Pollaro, the Times talked to a bunch of design experts for their thoughts instead. Their observations ranged from “swanky” to “stifled”; one critic noted, “I was surprised to discover that the bathtub was a bathtub; I thought it was an ashtray.” Here are our favorite gems (and yes, the Chanel No. 5 ad was referenced):  1. “The shiny metal surprised me specifically; the mod Trumpian swankiness, in general.”  2. “These pieces are too nice; I do not hear Mr. Pitt’s voice unleashed with full authority.”  3. “Mr. Pitt, you are a great actor. Stay that person, with all of his confidence and drive and risk-taking, when designing. These first pieces are audition monologues; you already have the part.”  4. “[A piece I would want in my home is] possibly the oval table — in the guest room of a second home, if I owned a second home.”  5. “I’m not convinced after seeing three table designs (and a bathtub that reminds me of an ashtray) that Brad Pitt should quit his day job to be in the furniture or product design game. Unless that means I can be an actor for a day and get paid $7 million to star in a Chanel No. 5 perfume ad.”"	who beautiful wallet in new news yuck	the things we ik 2 doing ass	is we do needs thats something “ themselves	prayn 2 sei	why who did a of way behaved	TheCut saw some pictures in a past W magazine with a house of his he designed amazing taste design has always been a passion of his

25	gossipcop-9208934379	"In his upcoming book 'The Kardashians: An American Drama,' Jerry Oppenheimer takes a closer look at two of the longest-circulating rumors about the Kardashian family.  First is the claim that Kris Jenner had an affair with her husband's best friend Orenthal James Simpson, which appears to have first emerged after Kris split with fiancé Cesar Sanudo.  The second concerns the paternity of Kris' third child Khloe, who multiple sources close to the family believe was not the daughter of Robert.  That first claim still lacks any definitive proof or solid evidence the book reveals, while Oppenheimer speaks to a number of people who lend credence to the second claim by recounting conversations they had with Robert.  This latest work by the New York Times bestselling author will be released by St. Martin's press this September.  Scandal: Cesar Sanudo believed that his fiancee Kris Jenner was sleeping with both Robert Kardashian and OJ Simpson when they were engaged (Simpson and the Kardashians above in the mid-80s)  Sanudo's daughter Amber Carillo says in the book that although her father was the son of Mexican immigrants, he had some shocking opinions about interracial dating.  Origin: Sanudo (above with Kris) shared his thoughts with his daughter  She recounts one time when her father had been watching an episode of the family's E! reality series 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' and said to her: 'Why would Kris let her kids date black men.'  Carillo says she dismissed his remark by saying 'this is not the 1920s' and urging her father to 'get the fifties and sixties mentality about race out of your head.’  She goes on to reveal however that part of his anger likely stemmed from his belief that Kris had been cheating on him with both Robert and OJ.  'That racial mixing angered him. And that’s why he used to say Kris was sexually involved with OJ,' explains Carillo.  'How real that is, and did my dad witness it, I don’t think so. He said he was pretty sure that she was seeing OJ along with Kardashian, that she had an affair with OJ too.'  She later adds: 'He thought more or less that Kris would be with OJ and I had to correct him.'  OJ was a major part of Kris' life once she met Robert, as he lived with the pair and Robert's brother Tom at their home in Beverly Hills whenever he and first wife Marguerite were on the outs - which was very often in those final years of their marriage.  He was also with Robert when he first picked Kris up at the airport in Los Angeles, and by Robert's side when he flew to New York to take his future wife back after his relationship with Priscilla Presley came to an end.  On that trip the three stayed at The Plaza and went to Studio 54 before jetting off to Montreal where Simpson was providing commentary for ABC Sports at the 1976 Summer Games.  It was at those Olympics that Bruce Jenner shot to fame with his win in the decathlon.  More allegations: Robert's pastor Kenn Gulliksen and best friends Joni Midigal and Larry Kraines all say that Robert told them privately that he was not Khloe's father (Khloe and Robert above in the late 1980s)  Family affair: His love for Khloe was the same as it was for his two oldest daughters regardless of this fact all three claim, and he refused to ever take a DNA test (family above in the late 1980s)  Fila-ing it: Robert and Kris welcomed their first child, daughter Kourtney, just nine months after their wedding (above in 1979)  Two years later, Kris and Robert walked down the aisle, with their first daughter Kourtney coming just nine months after the pair said 'I do.'  Her birth in 1979 was followed by the arrival of little sister Kim just 18 months later, quickly filling out the family.  Then, a little less than four years after Kim was born, Kris gave birth to a daughter Khloe.  Much has been said over the years about Khloe's paternity, with Kris and her daughters all summarily shooting down any stories or reports claiming that Robert was not the father of Kris' third child.  Robert never spoke publicly about the matter, though in at least one legal filing in the aftermath of his separation from Kris years later was reported to have stated that he had 'four biological children.'  Kris and Khloe both say Robert was her father  That is not the story he told however to three of the people who were closest to him back at that time - his pastor Kenn Gulliksen, lifelong friend Joni Midigal and close confident and high school pal Larry Kraines.  'Kris and Robert had four children. Well they had three kids and somebody else’s kid,' reveals Gulliksen.  'Bob never asked my counsel but I simply heard from him that Khloe wasn’t his biological daughter.  He then states: 'He gave me no names of who the father was. But I certainly know it wasn’t OJ.'  Robert did however still love Khloe as if she were a daughter according to Gulliken.  ‘It was my strong impression from him that he loved Khloe very much but he said it in a way that implied she’s not my blood daughter, meaning his biological daughter,' he tells Oppenheimer.  ‘My understanding from him was that he and Kris hadn’t had sex during the period of time they would have had to had sex when Khloe was conceived.’  Kris has said many times in the past and wrote in her 2011 memoir that Khloe was conceived in Italy.  Kraines, who was actually at the hospital when Khloe was born, says that Robert told him soon after the delivery: 'It's all bulls***.'  Mystery man: Some have alleged that Khloe's real father is Kris' former hairdresser Alex Roldan (above in 2012)  Here comes the bride: New York Times-bestselling author Jerry Oppenheimer is telling all about Kris Jenner in 'Kardashians: An American Drama,' which is out in September (Kris and Robert Kardashain with Pastor Kenn Gulliksen at their 1978 wedding)  Despite these private conversation with friends in which he expressed that Khloe was almost certainly not his biological child, Robert refused to take the next step because of the kind of person that he was according to Midigal.  ‘He made a decision that no matter who Khloe’s father was that Robert was going to love her as his own, and it was all done. That was his decision. It was the honorable way of doing it, and the respectful way,’ says Midigal.  'He didn’t want a DNA test done, he didn’t want to find out anything. He told me, ""I love Khloe. She’s wonderful. She’s mine, period.” But he knew she wasn’t his. His confirmation to me was, ""She’s mine and I don’t care who the father is.'""  New York Times-bestselling author Jerry Oppenheimer is telling all about Kris Jenner in 'Kardashians: An American Drama,' which is out in September  Among those whose names have been floating around as possibly being Khloe's father are Simpson and Kris' hairdresser Alex Roldan.  Kylie Jenner made light of the claims that Roldan was Khloe's father back in 2012 by tweeting a photo of Khloe and the hairdresser, writing: ''First official photo of my sister and her dad! Like father like daughter!'  Khloe meanwhile addressed the rumor in March of last year on an episode of her now cancelled show 'Kocktails With Khloe.'  It came up during a conversation about the dark side of fame, with Khloe expressing her distaste for claims that had been made by her father's widow Ellen Pearson.  'I think the thing that most became overwhelming was when, like, the stuff happened with one of my dad’s wives,' said Khloe.  'She wanted to come out, like, 10 years later after my dad passed away and said that I’m not his daughter and that he confided in her and blah-say-blah.'  She went on to say: 'I was like, ""Listen, you can talk about me and my sisters all you f***ing want. Do not talk about my dad.… He’s not here!”'  It is all happening once again however, only this time with three people and not just one claiming Robert confided in them about the fact that Khloe was not biologically a Kardashian."	means her hes so to won just was but maturity	off is on a deeply same sucks	theres these so partridge name if ellemagazine back respect	keith na	wear made	a paternity test can fix all doubt

(Photo: Chris Pizzello, Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)  Ariana Grande may have spoken too soon when she sang about having no tears left to cry.  On Wednesday night, Grande tweeted a joke about the lyrics of her single, suggesting that its wisdom may have been premature.  ""Remember when I was like hey I have no tears left to cry and the universe was like HAAAAAAAAA (expletive) u thought,"" she wrote on Twitter.  Grande originally released ""No Tears Left To Cry"" in April as a triumphant comeback single, her first new song since the tragic bombing at her Manchester concert in 2017. And while a rosy few months followed for the star in which she began dating and quickly became engaged to Pete Davidson, things came crashing down in September, when her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller died of an accidental drug overdose.  Following Miller's death, Grande and Davidson ended their engagement in October, with Grande canceling her appearance as the musical guest on the Sept. 29 season premiere of ""Saturday Night Live,"" for ""emotional reasons.""

She doesn’t even remember this as she has a huge gash in her head and blood on the brain. This was sent to me by a Good Samaritan that didn’t know who he was helping but once he saw the story online he contacted me knowing we’re friends and he was following me. If anyone was a witness to this accident please inbox me any information you may have. As you can imagine Melyssa doesn’t remember much so I’m hoping witnesses will come forward and assist in putting the pieces back together. She was hit by an 18 wheeler.
